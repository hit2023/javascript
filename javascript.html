    <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language. It
        is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and
        many non-browser environments also use it.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>What is the use of isNaN function?</h2>
    <p>In JavaScript NaN is short for "Not-a-Number". <br>

        The isNaN() method returns true if a value is NaN.<br>

        The isNaN() method converts the value to a number before testing it.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>What is negative Infinity?</h2>
    <p>The negative infinity in JavaScript is a constant value that is used to represent a value that is the lowest
        available. This means that no other number is lesser than this value. It can be generated using a self-made
        function or by an arithmetic operation. </p>
    <p>Negative infinity is different from mathematical infinity in the following ways: <br>

        * Negative infinity results in -0(different from 0 ) when divided by any other number.<br>
        * When divided by itself or positive infinity, negative infinity return NaN<br>
        * Negative infinity, when divided by any positive number (apart from positive infinity) is negative
        infinity.<br>
        * Negative infinity, divided by any negative number (apart from negative infinity) is positive infinity.<br>
        * If we multiply negative infinity with NaN, we will get NaN as a result.<br>
        * The product of 0 and negative infinity is Nan.<br>
        * The product of two negative infinities is always a positive infinity.<br>
        * The product of both positive and negative infinity is always negative infinity.</p>

    <h2>Which company developed JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript was created at Netscape Communications by Brendan Eich in 1995. Netscape and Eich designed JavaScript
        as a scripting language for use with the company's flagship web browser, Netscape Navigator.</p>

    <h2>Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?</h2>
    <p>Javascript is a very important language when it comes to learning how the browser works. Often there are times we would like to add dynamic elements/content to our web pages. This post deals with all of that.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</h2>
    <p> A ViewState is a state of a page within a browser wherein the values of controls persist when post back operation is done. When another page is loaded, the previous page data is no longer available. - SessionState is the data of a user session and is maintained on the server side.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>What is === operator?</h2>
    <p>The strict equality (===) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result. Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be different.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>How can the style/class of an element be changed?</h2>
    <p>To change all classes for an element: <br>
        document. getElementById("MyElement"). className = "MyClass"; (You can use a space-delimited list to apply multiple classes.)</p>

    <h2>How to read and write a file using JavaScript?
    </h2>
    <p> 1 file=fopen(getScriptPath(),0); The function fread() is used for reading the file content. <br>
        2 str = fread(file,flength(file) ; The function fwrite() is used to write the contents to the file. <br>
        3 file = fopen("c:\MyFile.txt", 3);// opens the file for writing.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>  The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:<br>
           *  for statement.<br>
           *  do...while statement.<br>
           *  while statement.<br>
           *  labeled statement.<br>
           *  break statement.<br>

           <h2>How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?</h2>
           <p>There's a function called parseInt() in JavaScript, this is used for parsing a string as an argument and it returns an integer of the specified radix (basically the base of the numerical system) as output.</p>
           <hr>
           <h2>What is the function of the delete operator?</h2>
           <p>The delete operator removes a property from an object. If the property's value is an object and there are no more references to the object, the object held by that property is eventually released automatically.</p>

            <h2>What is the use of Void (0)?</h2>
            <p>One of the main reasons to use void(0) is to prevent the page from refreshing, especially when using anchor tags <a> . In JavaScript-enabled browsers, <a href="javascript:void(0)"></a> prevents the default action of clicking a hyperlink, which is navigating to a new URL.</p>
           <hr> 
           <h2>How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?</h2>
           <p>Approach: We can use window. location property inside the script tag to forcefully load another page in Javascript. It is a reference to a Location object that is it represents the current location of the document. We can change the URL of a window by accessing it.</p>
           <hr>
           <h2>What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?</h2>
           <p>It is very slow because as inner HTML already parses the content even we have to parse the content again so that's why it takes time. When we have used the event handlers then the event handlers are not automatically attached to the new elements created by innerHTML.</p>
